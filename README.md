## About

EDMC Overlay is a helper program for Elite:Dangerous, It provides a means for 
a program such as EDMC to display simple messages in the game's DirectX window.

## Compatibility

* Currently supports 64Bit Elite:Dangerous (Horizons) on Windows Only.
* 64bit Non-Horizons may work. YMMV.
* Apple support is not likley (I don't have a Mac)
* "Windowed" or "Bordless Fullscreen" mode only.

## Installation

This is released as an installable EDMC Plugin, download the msi file from the 
[Releases page](https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay/releases) and run the 
installer as the same windows user you use to play Elite:Dangerous

# Protocol

EDMC Overlay offers a very very simple line-json based network protocol.

The service when started will listen on TCP 127.0.0.1:5010.  If EDMCOverlay cannot
detect EliteDangerous64.exe it will exit silently.
 
Assuming EliteDangerous64.exe is running, you may send a single JSON message (on one line)
Like so:

```
{"id": "test1", "text": "You are low on fuel!", "size", "normal", color": "red", "x": 200, "y": 100, "ttl": 8}
```
Supported colors values are:
 "red", "green", "yellow", "blue" or "#rrggbb".

Supported size values are: 
 "normal" and "large"

Additionally, you may draw rectanles by setting the "shap" to "rect" and setting the "color" and/or "fill" values.

```
{"id": "fred", "shape": "rect", "x": 100, "y": 10, "w": 30:, "h": 5, "fill": "red", "color", "#ccff00"}
```

The server will process this as an instruction to display the message "You are low on fuel!"
in red text at 200,100 for 8 seconds.
 
Be sure to send a newline ("\n") character after your message. You may need to flush the 
socket.

There are (currently) no response values from the service.
